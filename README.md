Added parts below

Gameplay element that uses Dot Product:
We utilized a dot product addon in this game that makes the Gargoyle rotate to
look at the player (John Lemon), making the gargoyles more dangerous as their
"PointOfView" will have you in sight as it always faces you.

Gameplay element that uses Linear Interpolation:

Particle Effect:
We created a particle effect on John Lemon himself using the Dust Mote texture
It will look like little balls of light are falling off of John Lemon and this is because we deemed John Lemon special enough to have a particle effect
